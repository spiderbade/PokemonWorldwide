Credit to Zerokid for compiling all of this in his free resource game, Pokémon Zero.
You can also use his scripts from the game, which work with the move function codes in the moves PBS file. If you aren't using this change the function codes (4th section of the item line) in the pbs to match yours.
Please note they aren't 100% up to date with Gen 8, but you can find most of what's missing in the Gen 8 moves and abilities thread on Pokécommunity.
Pokémon Zero does contain all of Gen 7, however.
Gen 6 stuff is in the code by default, but you need to define all the moves and abilities, which are done here.
Not all the SwSh DLC stuff, Gigantamax, are added.
Bare that in mind when you use these.
